# Text-to-Image Grader Redesign Architecture

## 📐 Design Philosophy

The redesigned grader follows a **hierarchical metric structure** with clear separation between:
1. **North Star Metric** (Primary quality indicator)
2. **Supporting Metrics** (Multi-dimensional quality assessment)

---

## ⭐ North Star Metric: Soft-TIFA GM

### What is Soft-TIFA?
**Soft-TIFA (Soft Text-Image Faithfulness through Atomic evaluation)** measures how well an image satisfies atomic visual criteria extracted from the prompt.

### Why Geometric Mean (GM)?
- **Compositional AND Logic:** All criteria must be satisfied (not just averaged)
- **Penalizes Missing Elements:** A single 0 score results in 0 overall score
- **Balanced Assessment:** Better reflects human judgment on completeness

### Methodology:
```
1. Extract 5-8 atomic facts from prompt
   Examples: "a red car", "on a highway", "sunny weather"

2. Score each atom probabilistically (0.0 to 1.0)
   VLM evaluates: Is this criterion met in the image?

3. Calculate Geometric Mean:
   Soft-TIFA GM = (score₁ × score₂ × ... × scoreₙ)^(1/n) × 100
```

### Example:
```
Prompt: "A red car on a highway with mountains in background"

Atoms:
- "A car is present" → 1.0 ✓
- "The car is red" → 0.9 ✓ (slightly orange-red)
- "Car is on a highway" → 0.8 ✓ (looks like highway)
- "Mountains in background" → 0.0 ✗ (no mountains visible)

Soft-TIFA GM = (1.0 × 0.9 × 0.8 × 0.0)^(1/4) × 100 = 0/100
```

**Result:** Low score because mountains are missing (compositional AND logic).

## 📊 Supporting Metrics

### A. Image-Only Quality Metrics
**Purpose:** Assess technical quality independent of prompt

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **BRISQUE** | Blind spatial quality (blur, noise, compression artifacts) |
| **NIQE** | Natural image statistics (deviation from natural distributions) |
| **CLIP-IQA** | CLIP-based perceptual quality |

**Implementation:** `src/metrics/image_quality.py` - Laplacian-based quality estimation

---

### B. Alignment Metrics
**Purpose:** Measure text-image correspondence

#### Model-Based (Fast)
| Metric | What It Measures | Best For |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **CLIPScore** | Global semantic alignment (embedding cosine similarity) | Overall intent match |
| **VQAScore** | Visual QA-based verification | Factual correctness |
| **AHEaD** | CLIP attention-based alignment | Fine-grained matching |
| **PickScore** | Human preference estimation | Subjective quality |

#### VLM-Based (GPT-4o)
| Metric | What It Measures | Best For |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **TIFA** | QA pair verification | Factual accuracy |
| **DSG** | Davidsonian semantic primitives | Structured verification |
| **PSG** | Scene graph structure | Object relationships |
| **VPEval** | Visual programming evaluation | Compositional reasoning |

**Implementation:** `src/metrics/alignment.py` - CLIP/ViLT models + GPT-4o VLM

---

### C. Safety Metrics (T2ISafety Framework)
**Purpose:** Responsible AI evaluation

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Toxicity** | Harmful content (hate speech, violence, NSFW) |
| **Fairness** | Bias and stereotyping |
| **Privacy** | Identifiable information |

**Implementation:** `src/metrics/safety.py` - GPT-4o VLM evaluation

## 🎯 Evaluation Workflow

### Single Image Evaluation
```
1. Calculate Soft-TIFA GM (North Star)
   - Extract atomic criteria from prompt
   - Evaluate each atom probabilistically
   - Calculate geometric mean
   ↓
2. Run T2ISafety evaluation
   ↓
3. Calculate Image Quality metrics (BRISQUE, NIQE, CLIP-IQA)
   ↓
4. Calculate Alignment metrics (CLIPScore, VQAScore, AHEaD, PickScore)
   ↓
5. Run Expert VLM evaluation (GPT-4o qualitative assessment)
   ↓
6. Generate comprehensive report
```

### Batch Evaluation
```
For each image:
1. Extract atoms → Evaluate atoms → Calculate Soft-TIFA GM
2. Record results with all metrics

Summary:
- Average Soft-TIFA GM (primary metric)
- Per-image breakdown
```
